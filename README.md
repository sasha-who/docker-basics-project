# Docker Basics Project

A simple project demonstrating how to use Docker to run a Node.js application and MongoDb inside the Docker containers attached to the same network.

Useful commands for local development can be found in [`docker-commands.md`](./docker-commands.md).

Also, [`docker-compose.yaml`](./docker-compose.yml) is provided for easy run of multi-container Docker application.
